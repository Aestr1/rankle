- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to represent intellect, strategy, and daily challenge.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E1D5ED), a very pale version of the primary hue.
- Accent color: Bright teal (#00BCD4), to highlight interactive elements like CTAs, creating contrast against the purple tones.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif, to be paired with 'Inter'.
- Body Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, neutral look.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different game types. Consider duotone icons, using the primary and accent colors.
- Card-based design for games, with clear visual separation. Prioritize readability for scores and completion status.
- Subtle transition animations on card hover and completion status updates to provide feedback.
